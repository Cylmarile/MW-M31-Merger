# MW-M31-Merger
Codes for my bachelor project about the Milky-Way / Andromeda merger at the University of Helsinki, supervised by T. Sawala. Please read the report before reading those programs. 

- Pointmass_Single_Variation_MWM31 corresponds to part 1.2 of the report. Contains a lot of coding mistakes, but works for what we want to do.
- Pointmass_Varying_all_parameters corresponds to the part 1.3 of the report
- MWM31merger_Galaxies corresponds to parts 2.1 and 2.2 of the report. Maybe the most important program to read if you want to understand what I have done.
- MWM31merger_Galaxies_heatmaps corresponds to part 2.3 of the report, mostly written by Till Sawala and inspired by MWM31_merger_Galaxies
- Onefile_Simulation_Galaxies is the preliminary code for part 3, requires testfile.npz and testfile2.npz to work
- Simulation_Galaxies corresponds to part 3 of the report. The main loop can be skipped by using data contained in file_galaxies.

Have a wonderful day :)
